    <string name="state_of_things">Of all the evils heaped upon black people in this country \n
        in the 20th century , it seems to me that job discrimination \n ,
        more than anything broke the resilience of black men .\n
        Men need to work .They need to know that the sounds of \n
        their own exhaustion help to create the  kind of world in which they live .\n

    <string name="effect">The refusal to honor a black man\'s work-to let him know that the smell of his \n
        sweat led to just recompense , that his hands were his survival , and his sinews his passport to success  \n
        - has led to the degradation , the hostility
        and the lethargy now threatening to engulf us
